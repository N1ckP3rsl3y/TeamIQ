**Version:** v1.0.0-alpha-demo

# RedPen
## Overview
This project was proposed and is sponsored by Dr. Erika Konrad at Northern Arizona University, and is a professor of graduate courses in grammar and technical-writing.

Our project -- dubbed the name *RedPen* -- is an interactive quiz editing web application. The application is meant to take after the features from the New York Times' [*Copy Edit This!*](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/11/11/insider/copy-edit-this-quiz.html).

The following points are some of the main problems with *Copy Edit This!* that were noticed by Dr. Konrad:
* It has a set group of quizzes to choose from for an instructor assigning them.
* An instructor does not have any view in which they can create a class, and view the results of their students.
* The cost of the application is not desired by our sponsor nor her students.

So, our goal is to make a custom web application to address these problems and the professor, for her classes, can create custom quizzes and view the results of her students throughout the semesters.
